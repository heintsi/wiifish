Wii Fish
=======

Wii Fish is a Wiimote-controlled fishing game. 
The idea is that there is no need for display: the Wiimote is the interface for both playing and getting feedback.

The fishing game emulates ice fishing as it is. You can make light pulls to increase the fishes' interest in the bait, and when you feel a fish nibbling at the bait you need to make a stronger pull to catch it. The number of caught fish is indicated with the Wiimote's indicator leds.
