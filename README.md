Wii Fish
=======

Wii Fish is a Wiimote-controlled fishing game. 
The idea is that there is no need for display: the Wiimote is the interface for both playing and getting feedback.

The fishing game emulates ice fishing as it is. You start by lowering the bait into water, and then wait for fish to grab your bait. You can make light pulls to increase the fishes' interest in the bait, and when you feel a fish nibbling at the bait you need to make a stronger pull to catch it. The number of caught fish is indicated with the Wiimote's indicator leds. The maximum number of fish, therefore, is four.

Instructions on playing the game:
 1. Start a new game by pressing the ENTER key.
 2. Lower your bait into water by pressing the trigger button (B) in the wiimote.
 3. Wait for a fish to grab your bait.
 4. You can try to lure fish to your bait by making light pull gestures with the wiimote, much like you would do when ice-fishing.
 5. When a fish arrives, the wiimote rumbles as the fish is grabbing your bait.
 6. Make a strong pull gesture with the wiimote in order to pull the fish up.
 7. If you caught the fish, a led indicator in the wiimote turns on.
 8. Continue from instruction number 2, until you reach the amount of four fish.

HINT: Light pull gestures increase the probability of fish appearing at your bait. Though overtime, if no luring gestures are made, the probability of fish appearing decreases.
